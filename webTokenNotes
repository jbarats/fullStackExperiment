communication authorization


a standard
header
  -Algorithm (alg) to sign the token
  -Type always JWT

payload
  - issuer (iss) e.g. the authentication service
  - subject (sub) entity identified by said token
  - audience (aud) target audience for the JWT, you should consider rejecting those without an audience
  - expiry (exp) unix temstamp after which the token is not to be accepted
  - issuedAt (iat) the date the token was issued

signature
  - encoded header, encoded payload, secret, and crypto alg

e.g.
signature = Crypto(secret, base64(header), base64(payload))
creates
jbcOUQ2bbiYlfVtprEkaT_S6Y6yQnBDOAKDHIHjvl7g

tokens are decodable by anyone - don't put sensitive info

essentially the security happens by recreating the signature and comparing it (hashing)

e.g. if somebody edits their header to say admin, they will send the wrong signature
  (this is why the secret key is important
)
