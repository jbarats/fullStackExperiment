Pinia  (client side )
  state management solution
  components need access to the same data
  global store, storing states in single place
  (not meant to be a replacement for props and events)
  
  5-10 components (likely no need for store)
  start

import { defineStore } from 'pinia'

//unique name as first argument
export const useAlertStore = defineStore('alerts', {
})

Pinia:
globale state in stores
components can monitor status of state
actions mutate state of store from within components

every different global state, you just make a new pinia store (more modular than vuex)
